This is basically just a playground for boilerplate experimentations. Not recommended for public consumption.

#### Getting Set Up

##### Requirements

* node/npm
* bower

##### Installing

In the project root run `npm install` to load server dependencies. The server handles serving the app index, basic routing, and compiling the CSS via Stylus.

Next, run `cd public/app && bower install`. This will install client side dependencies.

#### Running the Server

From the project root run `node server.js`.
